# Linux:
--------
	What is linux:
	--------------
	> Linux is an open source operating system (OS) and IT infrastructure platform.
	> It was originally developed by linus Torvalds in 1991.
	> First version released in 1994.
	> The heart of the OS is the Linux Kernel.
	> Linux can be used as a Server or a Desktop.
	> Linux is the layer between application and hardware.
	
	copyright licences:
	-------------------
	Linux is released under the GNU general public license(GPL):
	That means anyone can run, study, share, and modify the softawre. The modified code can also be 
	redistributed, and even sold, but must be under the same license.
	
	Lesser GNU public license (LGPL):
	---------------------------------
	The GNU lesser public license is a free softawre license published by the free softawre foundation (FSF).
	
	Why linux is better:
	--------------------
	> Linux Protects your computer.
	> Reporting Bugs.
	> Freedom.
	> Enjoy Free and Unlimted Support.
	> Don't pay $100 for your OS.
	
	Linux in Cloud:
	---------------
	When is comes to cloud even on Microsoft's Azure, more than 60% of the inages on the Azure
	Marketplace and nearlly !/3 of virtual machines are Linux-based. Meanwhile, Amazon Web Services,
	Google Cloud and Orcale Platform up multiple distributions of Linux in their publicly available
	images.

	Linux Future Exensibility:
	--------------------------
	Linux continues to be the operating of the future, with more systems depending on it's
	stability and Exensibility.
	
	Linux Innovation:
	-----------------
	> Web 2.0 built on top Linux.
	> The Cloud revolution was founded on Linux.
	> Big data solutions, softawre-based storage application, and softawre enabled networking are Linux based.
	> Microservices and containerized applications are coming from the open source community around Linux.
	> The innovations of the future will be built using Linux.
	
	Linux Distributions:
	--------------------
	> Different Linux distributions with different goals and criteria for selecting and supporting the sotware.
	> Simply Linux Kernel plus Addtional softawre.
	> Each distribution can have a different focus.
	> Popular Distributions are:
		> RED HAT		> CENTOS
		> FEDORA 		> OEL
		> UBUNTU		> MINTOS
		> OPEN SUSE		> ARCH LINUX
		> KALI LINUX 	> MANDRIVA
		
	WHAT IS RED HAT:
	----------------
	> Red Hat, Inc. is an American multinational softawre company providing open-source softawre products to the entriprise company.
	> Founded in 1993, Red Hat has its corporate headquaters in Raleigh, North Carolina, with other offices worldwide.
	
	Why Red Hat Linux:
	------------------
	> red Hat Entreprise Linux is the world's leading entreprise Linux platform It's an open source OS.
	> It's the foundation from which you can scale existing apps-and roll out emerging technologies-across 
	bare-metal, virtual, container, and all types of cloud enviroments.
	
	Red Hat Popularity:

	> Red Hat 8 is very inteligent and matured operating system espicetlly designed for cloud applications. Red Hat 8 
	supports 100% the latest trending applicatins.
	> Modern IT is Hybrid IT. But turning a sprawing ecosystem into a true hybrid enviroment requironment requires an
	intelligent OS that makes those things possible. That OS is Red Hat Entreprise Linux 8.
	> Traditional datacentres to public cloud services-into a true hybrid enviroment requires a few things. anywhere. 
	Yhere's an operating system that makes thoese things possible.
	
	Linux Architecture:
	-------------------
	Every linux operating system has 4 layers.
				User Layer
					↓
				Shell Layer
					↓
				Kernel Layer
					↓
				Hardwaer Layer
	
	The Shell:
	----------
		> Shell is like a container. What they contaies, They contaies unix or linux commands. Every command executes from the container only.
		> Interface between users and Kernel O/S.
		> In Linux, we usually means a command line shell.
		> The shell is replaceable on a user-by-user basics.
		> In enables easy remote and automated administraton.
		> The shell is most commonly used to run commands.
		
	Types of Linux Shells:
	----------------------
		> GNOME			(GNU Network Object Model Enviroment)
		> KDE			(K Desktop Enviroment)
		> Sh 			(Bourne Shell)
		> Bash 			(Bourne Again Shell)
		> ksh 			(Korn Shell)
		> csh and tcsh 	(tee-see-shell)
		> zsh			(z shell)
		
		Find your shell: > echo $0
	
	Linux Kernel:
	-------------
	> Kernel is a heart of Linux OS.
	> The Kernel is the essential centre of a computer operating system.
	> It was interface between shell and hardware.
	What the kernel does:
	---------------------
			> Scheduling running programs.
			> Managing hardware.
			> Managing Memory.
			> Manages System Security.
			> Supports user programs.
	What runes with in the kernel:
	------------------------------
			> Device drives.
			> Networking.
			
	User Spaces & Process:
	----------------------
	User Spaces:
	------------
		> User Spaces consists of all processes running outside the Kernel.
	Processes:
	----------
		> Each Process has its own a private virtual memory space, a security context,
		a state, a process id number.
		Types of process:
		----------------
		> User Process.
			> Daemon process.
			> Kernel thread.

# FILE SYSTEM HIERARCHY STANDARD (FHS): 																		folder stracture.
		
		You want to store the data and retriving the data we can use file hierarchy standard.
		
		Linux uses the Filesystem Hierarchy standard (FHS) file system structure, which defines the names,
		location, and permission for many file types and directories.
			
		/ 	  --> : root directory or top level directory.
		
		/root --> : Files belongs to the superuser (root). The login prompt is "#".
		
		/home --> : Home directories..--> pictures, files, files to belongs to users.

		/boot --> : For boot OS. Files needed to boot the system. Contans kernal, other files used during system startup.
		
		/etc  --> : System configuration files..
		
		/usr  --> : user releated programs, softawre, libraries, read-only program data.
		
		/bin  --> : Used to store binaries (user commands) & executable programs.
		
		/sbin --> : Used to store super binaries (system commands) 
		
		/lib  --> : Library files for user applicatins.
		
		/var  --> : varible data , log files and mail and temp files.
		
		/tmp  --> : temporary files for users and programs. it allows users to read and write. temp folder...data is deleted when reboot, stores temporary files for user and system, till next reboot.
					don't store any important data under /temp.	
					
		/dev  --> : Device files for system hardware and I/O.		
		
		/mnt  --> : contaies the mount points for file systems mounted after the system booted.
		
		/media--> : Mount points for removable media, such as CD-ROM, USB..etc.
		
		/opt  --> : Third party tools, optional directory for files and programs.
		
		/proc --> : id means virtual fiel system. These are zero bytes in size, not used for storage.
		
		/lib64--> : 64 bit
	
	What are the minium partitation reqrired for install Linux:
	-----------------------------------------------------------
		You want to install any linux oprating system you must need two directorys first one is '/' and second one is '/boot' this two are 
		mandetory directory for install any linux system.
	
	
	Partition Layout:
	-----------------
	Total 50GB
	/ 		: 15GB		--> top level working directory.
	/boot	: 1GB		--> 
	swap	: 4GB		--> swap is virtual memory for improving system perfomance. (but how take the wap size the wise size is twise of the ram)
	/var	: 10GB		--> 

	Total 30
	/ 		: 10GB		--> top level working directory.
	/boot	: 1GB		--> 
	swap	: 4GB		--> swap is virtual memory for improving system perfomance. (but how take the wap size the wise size is twise of the ram)
	/var	: 7GB		-->

# Remote Server OS Installation:
---------------------------------
HOW to instal OS in remote server:
> Physical Server is located in another country you need to install operating system on the
remote server. How?
> Definitely you need helpdesk team help, who stay at in another country (DataCenter) location
either you can opt for vendor installation.
> In this video I am going to show Dell server.
> For other brands also it is similar process.

These Rmote Activities done by site engineer:
1. Rack the server hardware

# ACCESSING LINUX GUI & CLI:
----------------------------
> SSH Command Line - Putty, mRmoteNG, Multitab Putty, MobaExtream, xshell.
> GUI Remote Console, VNC, VM Console.

> yum install openssh* -y
> systemctl enable sshd
> systemctl start sshd

> firewall-cmd --permanent --add-services=ssh
> firewall-cmd --reload

# improve ssh connecting speed:
-------------------------------
windows cmd run as administrator
> cd drives/etc
> notepad hosts
192.168340.250 hostname

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# UNDERSTANDING REDIRECTION FEATURE:
------------------------------------
The basic work flow of any Linux command is that it takes an input and gives an output.

The standard input (STDIN) device is the keyboard.
The standard output (STDOUT) device is the screen.

With redirection, the above standard inputtoutput can be
changed.

Explained File Descriptor:

File Descriptor 	symbol 		Description

0 					<			Standard Input (STDIN)
1					>			Standard output (STDOUT)
2					2>			Standard Error (STDEERR)

> mail -s "Thank you" username < /tmp/mail

> * * * * * passwd roto 2> /tmp/error		(capture error msgs)
