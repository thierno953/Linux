# Linux

#	What is linux:
	> Linux is an open source operating system (OS) and IT infrastructure platform.
	> It was originally developed by linus Torvalds in 1991.
	> First version released in 1994.
	> The heart of the OS is the Linux Kernel.
	> Linux can be used as a Server or a Desktop.
	> Linux is the layer between application and hardware.
	
	COPYLEFT LICENCES:
	Linux is released under the GNU general public license(GPL):
	That means anyone can run, study, share, and modify the softawre. The modified code can also be 
	redistributed, and even sold, but must be under the same license.
	
	Lesser GNU public license (LGPL):
	The GNU lesser public license is a free softawre license published by the free softawre foundation (FSF).
	
	Why linux is better:
	> Linux Protects your computer.
	> Reporting Bugs.
	> Freedom.
	> Enjoy Free and Unlimted Support.
	> Don't pay $100 for your OS.
	
	Linux in Cloud:
		When is comes to cloud even on Microsoft's Azure, more than 60% of the inages on the Azure
	Marketplace and nearlly !/3 of virtual machines are Linux-based. Meanwhile, Amazon Web Services,
	Google Cloud and Orcale Platform up multiple distributions of Linux in their publicly available
	images.
		 
	Linux Future Exensibility:
		Linux continues to be the operating of the future, with more systems depending on it's
	stability and Exensibility.
	
	Linux Innovation:
	> Web 2.0 built on top Linux.
	> The Cloud revolution was founded on Linux.
	> Big data solutions, softawre-based storage application, and softawre enabled networking are 
	  Linux based.
	> Microservices and containerized applications are coming from the open source community
	  around Linux.
	> The innovations of the future will be built using Linux.
	
	Linux Distributions:
	> Different Linux distributions with different goals and criteria for selecting and supporting
	the sotware.
	> Simply Linux Kernel plus Addtional softawre.
	> Each distribution can have a different focus.
	> Popular Distributions are:
		> RED HAT.		> CENTOS.
		> FEDORA. 		> OEL.
		> UBUNTU.		> MINTOS.
		> OPEN SUSE.	> ARCH LINUX.
		> KALI LINUX. 	> MANDRIVA.
		
	WHAT IS RED HAT:
	> Red Hat, Inc. is an American multinational softawre company providing-source softawre
	products to the entriprise company.
	> Founded in 1993, Red Hat has its corporate headquaters in Raleigh, North Carolina, with other offices
	worldwide.
	
	Why Red Hat Linux:
	> red Hat Entreprise Linux is the world's leading entreprise Linux platform It's an open source OS.
	> It's the foundation from which you can scale existing apps-and roll out emerging technologies-across 
	bare-metal, virtual, container, and all types of cloud enviroments.
	
	Red Hat Popularity:
		> Banks.
		> Airlines.
		> Telecoms.
		> Healthcare.
		
	Red Hat Enterprise Linux8 (RHEL8):
	> Any cloud, Any workload, One OS.
	> Red Hat 8 is very inteligent and matured operating system espicetlly designed for cloud applications. Red Hat 8 
	supports 100% the latest trending applicatins.
	> Modern IT is Hybrid IT. But turning a sprawing ecosystem into a true hybrid enviroment requironment requires an
	intelligent OS that makes those things possible. That OS is Red Hat Entreprise Linux 8.
	> Traditional datacentres to public cloud services-into a true hybrid enviroment requires a few things.
	anywhere. Yhere's an operating system that makes thoese things possible.
	
	Linux Architecture:
		Every linux operating system has 4 layers.
				User Layer
					↓
				Shell Layer
					↓
				Kernel Layer
					↓
				Hardwaer Layer
	
	The Shell:
		> Shell is like a container. What they contaies, They contaies unix or linux commands. Every command executes from the container only.
		> Interface between users and Kernel O/S.
		> In Linux, we usually means a command line shell.
		> The shell is replaceable on a user-by-user basics.
		> In enables easy remote and automated administraton.
		> The shell is most commonly used to run commands.
		
	Types of Linux Shells:
		> GNOME (GNU Network Object Model Enviroment)
		> KDE (K Desktop Enviroment)
		> Sh (Bourne Shell)
		> Bash (Bourne Again Shell)
		> ksh (Korn Shell)
		> csh and tcsh (tee-see-shell)
		> zsh (z shell)
		
		Find your shell: > echo $0
	
	Linux Kernel:
	> Kernel is a heart of Linux OS.
	> The Kernel is the essential centre of a computer operating system.
	> It was interface between shell and hardware.
	> What the kernel does:
			> Scheduling running programs.
			> Managing hardware.
			> Managing Memory.
			> Manages System Security.
			> Supports user programs.
	> What runes with in thr kernel:
			> Device drives.
			> Networking.
			
	User Spaces & Process:
	User Spaces:
		> User Spaces consists of all processes running outside the Kernel.
	Processes:
		> Each Process has its own a private virtual memory space, a security context,
		a state, a process id number.
		> Types of process:
			> User Process.
			> Daemon process.
			> Kernel thread.
		
	Client Class OS : 		Win7, win10
	Server Class OS :		Windows server 2008 r2, 2012, 2012 r2, 2016, 2019

#USER MANAGEMENT SERVICE:

In Linux we have 3 types of Users:
	> Super or root user: User is most powerful user. He is the administrator user.
	> System User: 		  Users created by the software or applications.
	> Normal User:		  Normal users are the created by root user.
	
	--> root or super user (admin) - UID 0 	root 	/root	/bin/bash
	--> system user _ UID 1-200 (mapped) & 201-999	ftp,sh,apache	/var/ftp,etc	/sbin/nologin

Package Management (rpm vs yum):
	A package format is a type of archive containing computer programs and
	additional metadata needed by package managers.
	In simple, software installations, manages and uninstallation will be taken care
	by Linux Package Manager.
	
	rpm is the Package manager for RedHat systems
	Rpm: RedHat Package Manager.
	
	> serch google > rpm for  httpd	> copy the link
	> wget packagename
	> rpm -ivh package name
	problem with rpm is, it cannot resolve dependencies automatically, so we have YUM
	> cd /etc/yum.repos.d/
	
	To install epel repository:
	
	> yum install -y https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
	> yum-config-manager -enable epel
	> yum repolist
	
	> yum history
	> yum history ID
	> yum history undo ID
	> Yum history rollback ID
	> yum history info ID
	> /var/log/yum.log

STORAGE MANAGEMENT ON LINUX:

	In Linux, All torage devices appears in /dev
	
	/dev/sda/ and sda1		(sda-->xvda)
							(s-SCSI/SATA Disk)
							 Disk A
							 Partition 1

	/dev/xvda  : Entire disk 	
	/dev/xvdal : SCSI/SATA Disk A Partition 1
	
	EBS: Elastic Block Storage
		 Storage option for ec2 instances
		 Make sure instance and volume are in same  AZ
		 
	> lsblk			( list all block devices in the liux machine) (to find how many drives we have)
	> fdisk		
	> fdisk -l
	> mount
	> umount
	> umount -d
	> df
	> df -h			(stoarage usage deatails)
	> df -Th		(shows info about volumes and mount points)

	> file -s /dev/volumename		(if you see only "data" that means there is no file system avaliable with in this newelly associated volume you need to setup file system for this block device)	(information aout the file system type)
	> mkfs -t xfs /dev/volumename 	(creating a file system)
	
	Run xfsprogs package if any error comes "mkfs.xfs" not found perform this > yum install xfsprogs
	
	"mkfs.xfs is not available" your getting such kind of isue you need to exegute  ( > yum install xfsprogs)

	> mkdir Suhkanth			(create directory)
	> mount /dev/volumename		(mound volume)
	
	Add an entry in fstab for permanent mount:
	
	> cp /etc/fstab/ /etc/fstab.bkp		(create backup for safe side)
	> cat /etc/mtab
	> vim /etc/fstab					(gives us information about what need to write in fstab)

 FILE COMPRESSION & ARCHIVING:

It is useful to store a group of files in one file for easy backup, for transfer to another directory, or for
transfer to another computer.
It is also useful to compress large files; compressed files take up less disk space and download faster via the
Internet.
It is important to understand the distination between an archive file and a compressed file.

COMPRESSED FILES:
It is a collection of files and directories that are stored in one file and stored in a way
thhat user less disk space.

ARCHIVING:
It is a collection of files and directories stored in one file. The achive files in not compressed
it uses less disk space.

NOTE: An archive file is not compressed file can be an archive file.

COMPRESSING FILES:

Red Hat Linux provides the bzip2, gzip, and zip tools for compression from a shell prompt.

The bzip2 and gzip compression tools are recommended because it provides the most compresion and is
found on most UNIX-like operating systems.

To transfer files between Linux and other operating system such as MS Windows, use zip because it is
more compatible with the compression utilities available for Windows.

Compression Tool		File Extension			Decompression Tool

bzip2					.bz2					bunzip2
gzip					.gz						gunzip
zip						.zip					unzip

	> bzip java				
	> bunzip java.z2	
	
	> gzip java				(zip the file)
	> gunzip java.gz		(unzip the file)
	
	> zip java.zip java		
	> unzip jaa.zip

ARCHIVING FILES:

TAR: (TAPE ARCHIVE)
A tar file is collection of sevral files/or directories in one fiel. this is a good way to reate
backups and archives.
SYNTAX: $tar [option] [archive-file] [file or directory to be archived]

	OPTIONS:
		-c 	> Create a new archve
		-v  > Verbose information
		-f 	> creates archive filename
		-t  > show tar file content
		
		-r  > append files to the end of an archive
		-z  > compress the file with gzip
		-j  > compress the tar file with bzip2
		-x  > extract files from an archive

	--wildcards: specifypatterns in Unix tar command.
	
	> tar -cvf maybackup.tar myfile aws java templates		(tar is used to combine multiple file to single file)
	> tar -czvf maybackup.tar.gz myfile aws java templates	(combine multiple file to single file with compression)
	> tar -cjvf maybackup.tar.bz2 myfile aws java templates	(combine multiple file to single file with compression)
	> tar -tvf maybackup.tar								(shows the content in the file)
	> tar -rvf maybackup.tar accessfile 					(add new source to exsting tar file)
	
	> tar -xvf maybackup.tar 								(extract the file)
	> tar -xvf maybackup.tar -C devops 						(extract the file to directory)

MANAIPULATEING TEXT WITH SED & GREP:

SED (STREAM EDITOR) and GREP (GLOBAL REGULAR EXPRESsION PRINT) are powerful
ways to save time and make your work faster.
When we deal with log files, text files, or a piece of code, we need to understand that all of these consist of
characters.
When the length of the file is large, it becomes a necessity to filter out certain patterns in order to make
your debugging easier.

SED (STREAM EDITOR):

SED is mainly used for text substitution, find & replace but it can also pertorm other text manipulations
like insertion, deletion, search etc.
It also supports the use ot regular expressions, which makes SED an even more powertul test manipulation
tool.
SED perform complex pattern matching.

	SYNTAX: $sed Options... [SCRIPT] [INPUTFILE...]
	
	> sed 's/ansible/linux/' filename			(replace the word in the fiel)	this wont update the file just display the content
	> sed 's/ansible/linux/g' filename			(replace the word in the file globally)
	> sed 's/ansible/linux/ig' filename			(replace the every word in the file)
	
	
	
	> sed -i 's/ansible/linux/' filename		(replace the word in the fiel)	this is will update the file
	> sed -i 's/ansible/linux/ig' filename		(replace the word in the fiel)
	
	> sed -n '5,10p' filename					(display the content 5 to 10 lines)
	> sed  '10,20d' filename     				(delete the 10 to 20 lines  in the file)
	> sed 's/#/ /' filename						(remove the #)
	> sed 's/ansible/linux/' filename >> filename			(save the outup with new file)   
	
GREP (GLOBAL REGULAR EXPRESSION PRINT):

Grep is uscd to print lines matching a regular expression.
Use grep to search for lines of text that match one or many regular expressions, and outputs only the
matching lines.
It is one of the most uscful command on Linux and Unix-like systems, which is a powerful file pattern
searcher.

	SYNTAX: $grep [options] pattern [files]
