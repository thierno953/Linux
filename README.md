## Linux 

Linux is the kernel of the system and the tool that allows us to communicate with the kernel and to access it indirectly to use it and this tool is called the shell and thanks to the shell we make sure that the commands that we will give a computer will be interpreted correctly by the kernel and that we won't have to do things as instructed to successfully access the hardware.

We can give simple commands to the "computer" and the shell communicates with the kernel to carry out its commands.

Two large families of shells:
The text shell: Bash

The graphical shell: Window, KDE, Unity
