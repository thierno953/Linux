# Wget in Linux
- wget is a free utility for non-interactive download of files from the web. It supports HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP protocols, and retrieval through HTTP proxies.
- wget is non-interactive, meaning that can work in the background, while the user is not logget on, which allows you to start a retrieval and disconnect from the system, letting "wget" finish the work. By constrast, most web browsers require constant user interaction, which make transferring a lot of data difficult.
